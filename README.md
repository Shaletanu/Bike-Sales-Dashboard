# Bike-Sales-Dashboard

 - In Bike sales datasets, it contains survey of bike buyers
 - It has information like marital status, income, gender, commute distance and age of coressponding persons etc.
 - The main challenge was to group the age into age groups. So, I used IF() formula to group the age like as below
      - age>54 is "Old"
      - age>=31 is "Middle Age"
      - age<31 is "Adolescent"
      
  - Formed three Pivot Charts for 
    - Average Income per Purchase where it's a bar graph showing gender versus income. Its showing that male who have more income also purchased bikes more.
    - Formed a line graph to get information containing the age groups who have purchased more bikes. Here, middle aged age group purchased more.
    - Inorder to view the commute distance, a line graph was formed and it says customers within 0-1 miles have purchased more.
